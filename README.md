# Hello. ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nick Melnick. I'm a technology executive, software engineer, and tinkerer from Toronto, Ontario. I currently spend my hobby time writing a bunch of TypeScript and learning Rust, as well as tinkering with retro computers. My professional time has me in Scala and infrastructure engineering. In the past, I used to write a bunch of JavaScript, Java, and Perl, and as we move further into esoteria, a bit of Vala (including the abandoned [Ambition Framework](https://github.com/ambitionframework)), and if one goes back far enough, there's some REALbasic, Visual Basic, C, and Pascal somewhere.
